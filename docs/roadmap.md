# ROADMAP

ArcOracle’s development follows a strategic roadmap, ensuring a phased approach to building a decentralized oracle on Solana. Below are the key phases, aligned with our vision to unveil the cosmos of data.

## Q1 2025: FOUNDATION & TOKEN LAUNCH

- **OBJECTIVE**: Establish ArcOracle’s foundation with research, team formation, and a token launch on Solana.
- **TASKS**:
  - Research existing oracles (e.g., Chainlink, Pyth) and evaluate @arcdotfun capabilities.
  - Recruit core team (Solana/Rust developers, Rig experts, data engineers).
  - Launch ARC token on Solana to fund development and incentivize the community.
  - Announce on Twitter: "ARCORACLE BEGINS! TOKEN NOW LIVE ON SOLANA, UNVEILING THE COSMOS OF DATA."
  - Build community via Twitter and Discord, sharing the vision and gathering feedback.
- **DELIVERABLES**: Research report, team roster, token launched, Twitter presence.

## Q2 2025: PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT

- **OBJECTIVE**: Develop and test a working prototype on Solana Devnet.
- **TASKS**:
  - Use @arcdotfun to fetch and process SOL/USD prices; write Solana Programs in Rust.
  - Build an off-chain bridge for data submission to Solana.
  - Test prototype on Solana Devnet for accuracy, latency, and costs.
  - Conduct initial security audits and implement signature verification.
  - Finalize branding (logo, banner) and launch a landing page with the roadmap.
- **DELIVERABLES**: Functional prototype, Devnet deployment, landing page.

## Q3 2025: MVP & TESTNET LAUNCH

- **OBJECTIVE**: Release a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on Solana Testnet for real-world testing.
- **TASKS**:
  - Expand data sources (e.g., X sentiment via @arcdotfun); optimize for multiple streams.
  - Deploy MVP on Solana Testnet; invite beta testers (Solana developers, DeFi projects).
  - Create developer documentation and release a draft whitepaper.
  - Host a Twitter AMA to showcase the MVP and gather feedback.
- **DELIVERABLES**: MVP on Testnet, developer docs, draft whitepaper, beta tester feedback.

## Q4 2025: MAINNET LAUNCH & EXPANSION

- **OBJECTIVE**: Deploy ArcOracle on Solana Mainnet and scale applications.
- **TASKS**:
  - Perform comprehensive security audits of smart contracts and off-chain services.
  - Deploy on Solana Mainnet; announce on Twitter: "ARCORACLE IS LIVE ON SOLANA MAINNET! UNVEILING THE COSMOS OF DATA WITH @ARCDOTFUN AND SOLANA."
  - Partner with Solana DeFi projects (e.g., lending protocols, DEXs) for adoption.
  - Release integration SDKs or libraries and prepare for decentralization.
- **DELIVERABLES**: Mainnet deployment, partnerships, integration SDKs.

## Q1 2026: DECENTRALIZATION & GROWTH

- **OBJECTIVE**: Transition to a decentralized oracle network and expand functionality.
- **TASKS**:
  - Implement a multi-node network using @arcdotfun for data validation; incentivize node operators with ARC tokens.
  - Add advanced data types (e.g., weather, AI predictions) and explore cross-chain compatibility (e.g., Ethereum).
  - Introduce a community governance model for data source approval and upgrades.
  - Launch a marketing campaign targeting Web3 developers and participate in Solana events (e.g., Breakpoint).
- **DELIVERABLES**: Decentralized network, new data feeds, governance framework.

## VISION

ArcOracle strives to become the leading decentralized oracle for Solana, driving innovation with reliable, real-time data and a vibrant community.
